# Progress Log

Keep this updated as work proceeds.

## 2025-01-14 - 18:00
- Seeded internal docs: overview, API contracts, data model, implementation notes, progress log. (Task: Create internal docs folder and seed plan docs)
- Scaffolded Phase 1 API route handlers: 6 endpoints with validation, error handling, logging
- Added server lib infrastructure: types, zod validation, errors, logging, services with mock data
- Wired UI pages to API stubs: dashboard, signals, analytics, settings all now fetch from API endpoints with graceful fallback to mock data
- Added comprehensive unit tests: 96 tests covering validation, services, API routes, error handling
- Resolved Jest configuration and Next.js Request import issues
- Created API integration tests to validate complete workflows

## Checklist (Phase 1) - COMPLETE âœ…
- [x] Create internal docs folder and seed plan docs
- [x] Scaffold Phase 1 API route handlers
- [x] Add server lib types, zod validation, errors, logging
- [x] Wire UI pages to API stubs (dashboard, signals, analytics, settings)
- [x] Add unit tests for route handlers and validation

## Phase 1 Complete Summary
**Backend Infrastructure**: 6 API routes, type-safe validation, structured logging, error handling
**Service Layer**: Mock data services matching UI expectations with full business logic
**UI Integration**: All pages now use real API calls with graceful fallback
**Test Coverage**: 96 comprehensive unit tests covering validation, services, routes, errors, integration workflows
**Quality Standards**: Consistent error responses, request logging, input validation, security practices

## Phase 2: Database Integration - COMPLETE âœ…
- **Prisma Setup**: Installed and configured with SQLite
- **Database Schema**: Created with proper indices and relationships
- **Services Migration**: All services now use database instead of mock data
- **Database Seeding**: Created seed script with realistic test data
- **Integration Testing**: API integration tests pass with database

**Ready for Phase 3**: Authentication, rate limiting, and real provider connectors

## UI Integration Complete
- **Dashboard**: Fetches recent signals from `/api/signals?since=-24h&limit=6`, shows loading states
- **Signals**: Fetches all signals with filtering via `/api/signals`, real-time refresh button
- **Analytics**: Fetches provider performance from `/api/providers/stats`, loading skeletons
- **Settings > Alerts**: Loads settings from `/api/me`, saves via `/api/alerts`
- **Settings > Sources**: Loads providers from `/api/me`, connects new providers via `/api/connect/{provider}`

## API Routes Created
- GET `/api/signals` - fetch signals with filtering
- POST `/api/filters` - create saved filters  
- GET `/api/providers/stats` - provider performance metrics
- POST `/api/alerts` - save alert settings
- POST `/api/connect/{provider}` - connect signal providers
- GET `/api/me` - user profile and settings

## 2025-01-15 - 21:37: Account Management Gap Analysis & Action Plan

### Current Account Management Status âœ…
**Working Features:**
- Basic user profile CRUD (name, email, timezone) via GET/PATCH `/api/me`
- Password update via POST `/api/me/password` 
- Settings UI with 4 tabs: Alerts, Sources, Account, Preferences
- Form validation and error handling in API layer
- Database schema for core user data

### Critical Gaps Identified ðŸš¨
1. **User Preferences Not Persisted**: Settings tab has beautiful UI but no backend
   - Dark mode toggle (not saved)
   - Compact view setting (not saved)
   - Default currency selection (not saved)
   - Trading preferences: risk level, auto-follow (not saved)

2. **Password Security Gap**: Current password not verified before update
3. **User Feedback Missing**: Console logs instead of user-facing notifications
4. **Database Schema Incomplete**: Missing preferences storage fields

### Executive Action Plan - Phase 2.5: Complete Account Management

**Priority 1: User Preferences System** (Immediate Impact)
- [ ] Extend User schema with preferences JSON field
- [ ] Create preferences validation schemas
- [ ] Add GET/PATCH `/api/me/preferences` endpoints  
- [ ] Wire preferences tab to backend
- [ ] Add toast notifications for user feedback

**Priority 2: Security & UX Improvements**
- [ ] Fix password validation (verify current password)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- [ ] Add loading states and optimistic updates

**Priority 3: Foundation for Phase 3**
- [ ] Prepare user session management patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for account flows
- [ ] Document authentication integration points

**Success Metrics:**
- All preferences tabs functional and persistent
- Password updates secure with current password verification  
- User feedback via toast notifications throughout settings
- 95%+ test coverage on account management flows

**Target Completion**: Before Phase 3 (Auth & Provider Connectors)

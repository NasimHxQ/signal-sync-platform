## How It Works

### User Flow

```
Landing Page
    â†“
User scrolls to "Join Waitlist" section
    â†“
Enters name and email
    â†“
Clicks "Join Waitlist" button
    â†“
POST /api/waitlist validates and stores data
    â†“
Success! User sees their position in line
```

### Data Flow

```
WaitlistForm Component
    â†“ (submits)
POST /api/waitlist
    â†“ (validates with Zod)
Database Check (duplicate email?)
    â†“ (if unique)
Insert into waitlist_entries table
    â†“ (count entries)
Return position to user
    â†“ (update UI)
Show success message
```
